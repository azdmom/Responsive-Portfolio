      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img class="auth-image" src="assets/images/DSC05877.jpg" alt="Drita Dhami">
      <p> I live in Narberth, PA with my husband and sweet 9 month old who has us both wrapped firmly around her dainty little
        finger. I've worked in the health care industry for seven years, most recently working with pharmaceutical and medical
        device companies in the regulatory industry. I spent my last few years at work often thinking, 'I wish I knew how
        to code that myself.' Thanks to University of Pennsylvania and Trilogy Coding Bootcamp, now I do!
      </p>
      <p> As a team member and project leader, I take value in building solid relationships with my internal team as well as
        clients and vendors. I believe that in every project, relationships based on a foundation of respect and goodwill
        will lead to successful outcomes. Iâ€™ve found that people do good work for people they respect and when everyone does
        good work, projects have successful outcomes.
